# Drum-Kit-Web---JS

This is a web-based drum kit application that allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing keyboard keys. The application was created using JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

The interface of the drum kit consists of a set of drum pads, each with a unique drum sound. When a user presses a corresponding keyboard key, the corresponding drum pad will animate and play the associated drum sound.

The application uses the `keydown` event to detect when a key is pressed, and the `audio` element to play the drum sounds. The sound files are loaded dynamically based on the key that was pressed.

This project demonstrates my skills in JavaScript event handling, HTML/CSS styling, and dynamic loading of audio assets. It provides an interactive and fun user experience while showcasing my ability to build dynamic web applications.
